# Task 2: Print a Triangle Pattern

## Objective
Your task is to write a C program that prints a triangle pattern using ats (`@`). The program should prompt the user to enter the height of the triangle, then print a right-angled triangle aligned to the left.

## Requirements
- The program must be written in C.
- The triangle's height should be taken as input from the user.
- The output should be a right-angled triangle aligned to the left side of the screen, made up of ats (`@`).

## Example Output
If the user inputs `5`, the output should be:

@  <br />
@@ <br />
@@@ <br />
@@@@ <br />
@@@@@ <br />

## Submission Guidelines
- Name your C source file as `triangle_pattern.c`.
- Ensure your code is well-commented to explain the logic and flow of your program.
- Submit your program by pushing it to your assigned GitHub repository within the deadline.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness: The program correctly takes user input and outputs the triangle pattern.
- Code Quality: The code should be well-organized and commented.
- Efficiency: While efficiency might not be critical for this task, consider the best practices in writing your loop(s).

Good luck!
